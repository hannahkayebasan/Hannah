✨ Welcome, Brave Souls! ✨
Two champions enter the realm: the mystical Mage and the mighty Warrior.
Each will take turns unleashing their powers — spells of frost or swings of steel.

⚔️ On your turn, choose wisely:

[1] Attack – a steady strike

[2] Special Move – stronger and risky

[3] Secret Power – unleash your ultimate force

The battle continues until one hero falls…
🌙 May the stars favor your chosen champion. 🌙
